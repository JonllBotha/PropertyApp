#Property App#

This is my final semester group project. We had to create a mobile application. We chose to create a real estate app and used Android Studio to complete the app. 
There are two types of users that can login. 1. is the agent, 2. is a client.

1: Agent
The agent is able to create listings, update and remove them.

2: Client
The client will be able to view different types of properties, e.g. a house for sale or an apartment to rent.
They will be able to contact an agent to book a viewing if they are close by.
